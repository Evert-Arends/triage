Triage Client
=============

This is the client for the [Hatching Triage](https://tria.ge) malware sandbox.


## Getting Started
When you have installed the client, you need to set the API key so it can
authenticate itself with Triage. You can do so by using the `authenticate`
subcommand:
```
./triage authenticate -t <API key>
```
You can find the API key on your [account page](https://tria.ge/account). Do
note that you need API permissions on your user account for a key to appear.


## Usage
```
triage -help
```
